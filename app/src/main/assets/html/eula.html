        <p>The Products transacted through the Service are licensed, not sold, to You for use only under the terms of this license, unless a Product is accompanied by a separate license agreement, in which case the terms of that separate license agreement will govern, subject to Your prior acceptance of that separate license agreement. The licensor (“Application Provider”) reserves all rights not expressly granted to You. The Android Product that is subject to this license is referred to in this license as the “Licensed Application.”</p>
        
        <ol type="a">
            <li><p>Scope of License: This license granted to You for the Licensed Application by Application Provider is limited to a non-transferable license to use the Licensed Application on any Android Product that You own or control and as permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in the App Store Terms and Conditions (the “Usage Rules”). This license does not allow You to use the Licensed Application on any Android Product that You do not own or control, and You may not distribute or make the Licensed Application available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute or sublicense the Licensed Application. You may not copy (except as expressly permitted by this license and the Usage Rules), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Licensed Application, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open sourced components included with the Licensed Application). Any attempt to do so is a violation of the rights of the Application Provider and its licensors. If You breach this restriction, You may be subject to prosecution and damages. The terms of the license will govern any upgrades provided by Application Provider that replace and/or supplement the original Product, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Consent to Use and Disclosure of Data: You agree that Application Provider may collect and use technical data and related information, including but not limited to technical information about Your device, system and application software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support and other services to You (if any) related to the Licensed Application. Application Provider may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify You (except as otherwise provided in this paragraph b.), to improve its products or to provide services or technologies to You. You also agree that Application Provider may disclose technical and related information gathered through the Licensed Application’s Products or Services, including, but not limited to information about Your device, system and application software, peripherals, global positioning location and other information or data. You represent by acceptance of these terms that You are the owner and/or authorized user of the device onto which the Licensed Application and its Products or Services will be downloaded or installed, and as the owner and/or authorized user, You expressly consent to the monitoring and gathering of such data and information, as well as the disclosure of such data and information to third parties (for example, Your employer or the company with which You have an independent contractor relationship) who contract with Application Provider.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Maintenance and Support. Application Provider is solely responsible for providing any support or maintenance for the Licensed Application.

Your rights under this license will terminate automatically without notice from the Application Provider if You fail to comply with any term(s) of this license. Upon termination of the license, You shall cease all use of the Licensed Application, and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the Licensed Application.</p></li>

            <li><p>NO WARRANTY: YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF THE LICENSED APPLICATION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SATISFACTORY QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY AND EFFORT IS WITH YOU. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES PERFORMED OR PROVIDED BY THE LICENSED APPLICATION ("SERVICES") ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND “AS AVAILABLE”, WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND APPLICATION PROVIDER HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. APPLICATION PROVIDER DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE LICENSED APPLICATION, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN, OR SERVICES PERFORMED OR PROVIDED BY, THE LICENSED APPLICATION WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE LICENSED APPLICATION OR SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE LICENSED APPLICATION OR SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLICATION PROVIDER OR ITS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE LICENSED APPLICATION OR SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Limitation of Liability. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL APPLICATION PROVIDER BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LICENSED APPLICATION, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF APPLICATION PROVIDER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In the event the Licensed Application fails to conform with any applicable warranty, then You may notify Google, and Google may refund the purchase price (if any) paid by Licensee to Google via the Google Store. In no event shall Application Provider’s total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00). The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose. APPLICATION PROVIDER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY INNAPPROPRIATE OR ILLEGAL USE OR DISCLOSURE OF ITS PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY INFORMATION, ABOUT YOUR DEVICE, SYSTEM, APPLICATION, SOFTWARE, PERIPHERALS, GLOBAL POSITIONING LOCATION AND OTHER INFORMATION OR DATA, AND YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE, RELEASE AND AGREE TO HOLD HARMLESS APPLICATION PROVIDER FROM ANY USE OR DISCLOSURE THAT IS IN VIOLATION OF YOUR PRIVACY OR OTHER RIGHTS.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Intellectual Property.

                <p>Licensor will indemnify You as to any rightful claim that Your use of Licensed Application or Services infringe a United States patent or copyright, provided that You give Licensor prompt written notice of the claim, allows Licensor to have sole control of the defense or settlement (if any) thereof, and cooperates fully with Licensor’ defense or settlement. In the defense or settlement of a claim, or if use of the Licensed Application or Services is enjoined, Licensor may, at its expense and option: (a) procure for You the right to continue using the Licensed Application or Services; (b) replace or modify the Licensed Application or Services so they become non-infringing.

Licensor, upon receipt of notice of a claim that could result in You indemnifying Licensor pursuant to this Section, shall give prompt written notice to You of the existence of such claim and shall permit You, if it so requests, either to conduct the defense of such claim or to participate with Licensor in the defense thereof and in any settlement negotiations relating thereto; provided however, that You shall not be required to pay any settlement amount that it has not approved in advance.</p></li>
